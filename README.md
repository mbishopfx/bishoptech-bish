## Introduction

Rift is a Bun + TanStack platform designed to make AI chat feel instant.

The core product goal is simple: maximize responsiveness and quality-of-life while preserving native provider behavior and enterprise-grade workspace controls.

Rift is built around TanStack Start, Rocicorp Zero for sync-first state and realtime updates, and the AI SDK for multi-provider support.

## Local Development

For detailed setup instructions, see **[DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)**.

### Setting up the Markdown Converter Worker (Required for file attachments)

Rift uses a Cloudflare Worker to convert uploaded files (PDFs, documents, etc.) to markdown. To set it up:

```bash
bun setup:markdown-worker
```

This interactive script will:

1. Check prerequisites (Node.js, wrangler CLI)
2. Authenticate with your Cloudflare account
3. Deploy the worker to Cloudflare
4. Generate and save a secure API token
5. Output the environment variables to add to your `.env` file

**Note:** You'll need a Cloudflare account. The worker runs on Cloudflare's free tier.
