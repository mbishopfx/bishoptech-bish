## Introduction

Rift is a Bun + TanStack platform designed to make AI chat feel instant.

The core product goal is simple: maximize responsiveness and quality-of-life while preserving native provider behavior and enterprise-grade workspace controls.

Rift is built around TanStack Start for full-stack delivery, Rocicorp Zero for sync-first state and realtime updates, and the AI SDK for multi-provider support.
