## Introduction

Rift is a Bun + TanStack platform designed to make AI chat feel instant.

The core product goal is simple: maximize responsiveness and quality-of-life while preserving native provider behavior and enterprise-grade workspace controls.

Rift is built around TanStack Start for full-stack delivery, Rocicorp Zero for sync-first state and realtime updates, and the AI SDK for multi-provider support.

> **Note:** This repository is a new version of Rift under active development [demo.rift.mx]. The live site at [rift.mx](https://rift.mx) runs an older version of Rift.

## Tech Stack

Rift is centered around this stack:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - runtime, package management, and scripts
- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) + [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) - full-stack React architecture
- [Rocicorp Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/) - sync-based data model and realtime cache layer
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) - multi-provider AI primitives and streaming
- [Railway](https://railway.com/) - default deployment target

Additional platform technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React 19](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) for auth, organizations, invitations, and roles
- PostgreSQL + Redis for persistence and stream continuity
- Qdrant for vector search/RAG workflows

## Repository Overview

This repository is a Bun + Turborepo monorepo.

- `apps/start/` - Primary Rift web app (TanStack Start + Vite)
- `packages/ui/` - Shared UI components
- `packages/utils/` - Shared utilities
- `packages/chat-scroll/` - Chat scrolling primitives
- `packages/tailwind-config/` - Shared Tailwind configuration
- `workers/markdown-converter/` - File-to-markdown Cloudflare Worker
- `reference/` - Upstream/reference snapshots (not active app code)

## Local Development

From repository root:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

### Setting up the Markdown Converter Worker (Required for file attachments)

Rift uses a Cloudflare Worker to convert uploaded files (PDFs, documents, etc.) to markdown. To set it up:

```bash
bun setup:markdown-worker
```

This interactive script will:

1. Check prerequisites (Node.js, wrangler CLI)
2. Authenticate with your Cloudflare account
3. Deploy the worker to Cloudflare
4. Generate and save a secure API token
5. Output the environment variables to add to your `.env` file

**Note:** You'll need a Cloudflare account. The worker runs on Cloudflare's free tier.

Useful commands:

```bash
bun run lint
bun run check
bun run build
```

Run tests for the main app:

```bash
cd apps/start
bun run test
```
